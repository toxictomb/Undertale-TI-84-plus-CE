A working way to get Undertale on a TI-84 plus CE ONLY!
# Installation
Go to the releases page and get the latest release.
Send those to your calulator.
Now go to the following website: https://github.com/calc84maniac/tiboyce/releases
Get TI-boy CE from the site and send it over to your calculator.
Now open TI-boy CE on your calculator
If you havent jailbroken your calc, get it from here: https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE it won't work otherwise
You should have the undertale files and TI-boy CE on your calc. Check your memory to confirm this
